## Design Pattern

> **The reason I've used only `function based` view is due to flexibility, and it's power, Yes I could've used `Class based` views
> for this but, that will require me to create new mixins and lots of snippet codes to write.**
> 
> **The ZEN of python says:** 
> > **Simple is better than Complex & Complex is better than complicated**
